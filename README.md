# DOSNIX

DOSNIX is a Unix-like operating system running on top of DOS, developed in C. It aims to provide a familiar Unix environment with basic commands and functionalities, all within the constraints of a DOS system.

## Features
- Unix-like shell with basic commands (`ls`, `cp`, etc.)
- Simple multitasking system
- Filesystem abstraction layer to emulate Unix-style paths
- Memory management system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A DOS-compatible environment (e.g., DOSBox, Virtual Machine with DOS)
- A C compiler compatible with DOS (e.g., Turbo C, DJGPP)

### Building DOSNIX

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `make` to build the project.

### Running DOSNIX

After building, you can run `dosnix.exe` from your DOS environment to start the shell.
